Analysis of cement manufacturing dataset in order to predict the strength from the components

## Technical background
When we examine the compressive strength of concrete, in the most cases we mean its strength at the age of 28-days. 
The water/cement ratio (usually rather liquid / binder) has a significant effect on the concrete's strength, the lower the w/c ratio, the higher the strength. We can see this correlation be present in the dataset.

It is important to differentiate the distinct types of binders because cement has the highest strength among them. The quantity of the supplementary cementitious materials has a significant effect on the strength.

The goal is to predict the strength from the proportion of the materials.
